---
So, hello everyone I am a blogger and also the website owner of Ytrlukas.github.io. I am currently living in France and I will tell you a few places which I recommend to go to in Europe. 

Rome, Italy

1. Colosseum

 
 
The Colosseum is a symbol of Rome and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
When you think of Italy, the first thing that comes to mind is architecture.
Construction began in AD 72 and was completed in about 8 years, 80 years, with the technology of that time.
It is one of the Seven Wonders of the World and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
It is also the site of the gladiator fight that was the motif of the movie Gladiator.
 
It is also a place where the meaning of this place is emphasized even more because the motifs are all taken from this place, such as modern soccer and Spanish bullfighting.
You can enter with the same ticket as the Roman Forum, and it is the number one tourist attraction that you must visit when you come to Rome.

2. Circo Massimo

 
 
Circo Massimo (anti-tank arena), a tourist attraction famous for the movie Ben-Hur, is now open to the citizens of Rome.
 It is famous enough to be called the 'National Stadium' and boasts a large scale.
Just like the gladiator fights at the Colosseum 2000 years ago, it was the only entertainment at the time.
It is said that he enjoyed anti-tank matches, and I think it will be easier to understand if you think of it as a modern version of horse racing.
It is now used as a walking and exercise course for Roman citizens.
It is one of the popular tourist attractions such as the outdoor opera theater.

3. Pantheon

 
 
The Pantheon, meaning 'serving all gods', is currently used as a church.
It is a temple that preserves the history of about 2000 years.
It was created by Agrippa, who was called his right arm during the reign of Emperor Augustus.
The Pantheon is a work called an innovation in the current architectural world, and for that reason, a huge dome of 43.3m was built.
It is said to be supported without a single pillar.
In addition, the value of the enormous marbles here is difficult to obtain in terms of current values.
It is a tourist attraction that is more meaningful because it completed such a huge structure 2000 years ago.

4. Foro Romano

 
 
The Roman Forum is a historic site in Rome where the saying 'Rome is a city where history is alive' is established.
It is one of the best-preserved sites in Italy.
You can enter with the same ticket as the Colosseum, and during the Roman Empire, people
In this way, it is a meaningful tourist attraction where you can guess that you have lived in such a culture.
In addition, the Roman Forum is said to be the most famous temple in Rome, the birthplace of a nobleman, and the birthplace of the Gladiator.
 It has been preserved, so you must visit it, right?
