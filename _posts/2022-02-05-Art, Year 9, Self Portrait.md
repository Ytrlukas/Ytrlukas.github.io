Self-portrait

Lukas

A self-portrait is an indication of an artist which can be represented in a variety of ways. For example, it can be drawn, photographed, painted and sculpted. The main difference between the modern self-portrait and the ancient one is that the modern one better expresses a representation of your identity ( who you are). However, the ancient one is closer to the physical appearance. In the modern one, we can often see a part of a face. For example: “Le Visage du Genie” and “Arizona Landscape” to indicate their imagination. However, in the ancient one, we can mostly see a whole face because they had to draw a drawing that is based on fact.

A drawing, Le Visage de Génie was painted by Georgio de Chirico in 1926. It is oil painted and used with many colors. In this drawing, there is a white male face on a wooden bridge  with 2 square holes. One of his white eyes is closed and one of his eyes has a hole in it.  There is a dark sky with many stars behind that white face. Due to the black sky and the white face, it causes a scary atmosphere. I personally like this drawing because it greatly inspired me to draw a self portrait in a different way.

The drawing, “Work in Progress” was painted by Gilbert Garcin in 2004. It is oil painted only white and black. In this black and white drawing, there is a man who is composed of many squares that are broken. A black background behind him makes a fearsome atmosphere. I suspect that this man was a politician or a president or a  person who worked for a country and I think that this drawing signifies that his word ended. However, that man in the picture was neither president or politician, he was Gilbert Garcin. To be honest, I didn’t like this drawing due to the breaking face. The main reason why I detest this image is that for me, the breaking face signifies that the word ends. However, it also inspired me that the self-portrait can be illustrated in a variety of ways.

In my drawing, there is a face with no hair that is looking at something right next to him. A white background behind that face signifies the brightness of the future. All the various objects in his face are what he likes. The Sun, the most essential thing for human beings. Apple, a great enterprise of a person who I strongly admire, Steve Jobs. Money and gold, the best way to be  rich. A book  called “Harry Potter”, a great book that strongly inspired me to write a book.

Those 3 drawings are very similar and different. I think  that “Le Visage de Génie” and “Work in Progress” are similar because of the holes in their faces. However, my drawing is just a face which is unlike their drawings. Therefore, I should develop more for the next time. I find that  the most interesting drawing is “Le Visage de Génie” because as I explained before, it greatly inspired me to draw a self-portrait in a very different way.


Conclusion:

My research on the subject of self portrait have not really shown what that type of painting is because people’s idea of self portrait changed over the years and the paintings can be really different from one artist to another one and according to the time it’s been done.
I realised that techniques of self portraits have evolved through the centuries from representing a physical appearance to the representation of people’s identity.
