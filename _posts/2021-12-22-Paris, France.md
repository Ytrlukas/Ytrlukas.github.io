So, hello everyone I am a blogger and also the website owner of Ytrlukas.github.io. I am currently living in France and I will tell you a few places which I recommend to go to in Europe. 

Paris, France

The first place which I strongly recommend is Paris, the capital city of France, located at the center of France. It is also known as a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture.There are many famous places such as the Eiffel Tower and Montepelier.

5 places to go iin Paris not to be missed
 
 
1 Center Georges Pompidou
The magnificent structure known as the 'Center Pompidou' is the center of European contemporary art and one of the three major art galleries in Paris. It is famous for adopting the concept of 'Inside Out' when a world-famous architectural team built the building. The ‘inside out’ design is an idea that exposes the machinery and equipment responsible for the function of a building to appear as if it were a part of the design of the building. In fact, when you look at the Center Pompidou, the building's cables, mechanical and hydraulic systems, vents, drains, and gas pipes are exposed, creating a unique atmosphere. The Center Pompidou was first opened to the public in 1977, and the modern and quaint steel facade that appears between the old-fashioned and elegant Plaza de Georges Pompidou creates a unique atmosphere.
 

2.(Champs Elysees)
Are you a traveler who wants to browse famous designer boutiques? Let's move on to the Champs Elysees, the center of Parisian fashion. If you like elegant and luxurious items, the Champs Elysees will feel like the Beverly Hills of Paris. The Champs-Elysees, which locals call “the street,” live up to its reputation, where you can find the following famous designer boutiques.
 
(Louis Vuitton)
(Gucci)
(Chanel)
(Maison Laduree)
(Cartier)
H & M
The Champs-Elysees are full of splendid and antique structures such as the Grand Palais, the Palais de la Découverte (Science Museum), and the Arc de Triomphe Monument. Although the Champs Elysees is only about 2 km long, it is a wonderful place to experience the beauty, old-world, wonder and pleasure of Paris all at once. Be sure to bring your camera if you visit the Champs Elysees, the symbol of Paris. You can take pictures of your life as much as you want. Also, while walking down the Champs-Elysees, stop by a local French bakery or cafe to sample French cuisine or enjoy a light snack. You will be happy in the world with delicious cuisine and beautiful scenery.
 

 
3. (Louvre Museum)
After the Eiffel Tower, one of the most popular attractions in Paris is undoubtedly the Louvre. If you are an art lover or a traveler who loves museums, this is a must-visit. As you enter the Louvre, home to some of the world's most outstanding works of art, the first thing that catches your eye is the iconic pyramid structure. This pyramid structure is designed to perfectly fit into the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe. If you go to the Louvre, don't miss out on the next work.
 
(The Mona Lisa)
(The Virgin of the Rocks)
(Venus de Milo)
 (Portrait of Louis XIV)
(The Coronation of Napoleon)
(The Seated Scribe)
(Women of Algiers)
(The Turkish Bath)
(The Young Beggar)
(Orphan Girl at the Cemetery)
(Bracelets of Duchess Angouleme)
(Crown of Louis XV)
 
4. (Eiffel Tower)
If you ask what is the symbol of Paris, the answer would be one hundred Eiffel Towers. If you come to Paris, it is natural to visit the Eiffel Tower, a world famous landmark of Paris! Step into the wonders of Parisian architectural art. A trip to Paris, the City of Lights, would not be complete without a visit to the Eiffel Tower! It is open from 9:30 am to 11:45 pm, and daily Eiffel Tower tours are offered for a fee. You can use the lift to go up to the top floor or use the stairs for exercise. However, from January 1 to December 19, you can use the stairs only from 9:30 am to 6:30 pm. When you arrive at the observatory, you can enjoy the panoramic view of Paris through the telescope.  The Eiffel Tower, which boasts a height of about 300 meters, was named after the French architect Gustav Eiffel and welcomed visitors to the Paris World's Fair held in 1889. More than 6 million travelers visit the Eiffel Tower every year.

5. Notre-Dame Cathedral
If you visit the Notre-Dame Cathedral in downtown Paris, step into the old history of Paris and attend Mass just like the locals did centuries ago. The cathedral was first opened to the public in 1260, and features elements of French Late Gothic. Intricate yet sophisticated stained glass and towering towers and spires soaring into the sky exude imposing beauty.
If you are a Catholic, be sure to visit and experience the glory of the Sacred Cathedral. Even if you are not a Catholic, the serene atmosphere unique to Notre Dame Cathedral will put your mind at ease.
* Note * Notre Dame Cathedral is temporarily closed for restoration from the fire on April 15, 2019.

 
6. Montmarte Hill
Montmartre Hill, the historical and cultural center of France, is also a must-see. Montmartre Hill is an old-fashioned and hip area, and you can often see locals wearing antique cars and wearing casual attire. It is also a place where you can immediately feel what the Parisian style is. A residential area characterized by a friendly atmosphere, large stone-paved streets lined with small local shops and cafes.
Montmartre Hill is also home to the eternal artists Picasso and Dali. The artistic and creative atmosphere that gave birth to them continues to this day. Enjoy panoramic Paris views from the foot of the Montmartre hill and end the day with a stop at one of the coolest clubs and bars. The Moulin Rouge, a cabaret that symbolizes the Montmartre hill, is also a must-see attraction. If you make a reservation, you can enjoy the performance as well as the meal.

Well, people Bon voyage!
