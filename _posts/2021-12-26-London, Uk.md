3 Must-Visit Attractions
I will introduce them in order ^^
For reference, this is based on Tripadvisor.


1. London Eye (charged)
The most beautiful way to see London
The entrance fee to the London Eye is expensive.
You must ride it at least once ^^


2. British Museum
A place where artifacts from all over the world are gathered in one place.
On the one hand, it was colonized or ruled by Britain.
It is a place where you can feel the pain of the suffering countries.


3. National Gallery
The British Museum features works from as many different countries as the British Museum.
A place to meet if you like art!


Well people, bon voyage!
