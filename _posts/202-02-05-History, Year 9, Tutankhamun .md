His father:
He made the entire religion of Ancient Egypt to worship only the sun god, Aten.
He banned over a thousand years of traditional Egyptian religion and forced people to change the way they worshiped. He even built a new capital city in honor of the god Aten called Amarna.

Ruling Egypt:
Many people of Egypt had been unhappy with the religious changes of his father. Tutankhamun and his advisors tried to fix all the changes that his father had made.
