The first assignement which we did at the beginning of year 9, in English class, in a french international School: English Debate


English Debate by Marc and Lukas
 
Social media affects you positively.
 
Introduction
 
Good morning S3, Mrs Dessert and our opponents; Salma and Alice.
Today, our group, Me and Marc, are standing here to express our views on social media. We are grateful to all who have given us the opportunity to speak in front of such an audience. We will declare that social media has a positive impact.	
Main points:
Social media helps people strengthen their relationships, create new connections, and find social support in tough times. According to one study, 81% of teens ages 13-17 say that social media makes them feel more connected to the people in their life, while 68% say using it makes them feel supported during tough times.
Being socially connected to others can ease stress, anxiety, and depression, boost self-worth, provide comfort and joy, prevent loneliness, and even add years to your life.
More than 25% of teens report social media making them feel less shy and 28% more outgoing. In addition to that, 20% reported feeling more confident as a result of their interactions on social media.
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary points:
 
One study found that 93% of adults use Facebook to connect with family while 91% with friends. And everyone knows how great social is at allowing us to stay (or get back) in contact with old friends, with 87% reporting they use social for  that very reason. 
 
-
Another study found that freshmen in college use social media to integrate themselves into their new school, build friendships, and that activity on social media even reduces the risk of dropping out. 
 
Conclusion:
Social media can affect you positively or negatively, depending on how you use it. For certain people who think that social media causes depression and sadness, our group wants to insist that it depends on the users and the way you use it. For example: Instead of being depressed because you are losing followers, try to convince yourself that it is time for you to improve what you post on your account. Don’t link any situation to your situation. Be conscious about your actions/ what you’re doing, don’t live your life through social media.
People who believe that social media is bad for you, why don't you guys consider stopping social media, including: Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.
