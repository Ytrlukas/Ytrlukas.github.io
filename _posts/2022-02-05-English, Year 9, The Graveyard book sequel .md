MY PITCH: 
Good Morning/Afternoon. My name is Marco, I am speaking to you to present my idea for the sequel to ‘The Graveyard Book’ by Neil Gaiman. The title will be ‘Valhalla or Not’. My title choice is related to the characters in the sequel, mainly the Valkyrie, Bod and Brianna. There will be 5 main characters, 2 of which we have seen in ‘The Graveyard Book’. They are: Nobody ‘Bod’ Owens, Bod’s Boss, the man Jack, the Valkyrie and Brianna O’Brien. The story will be told in 3rd person and in the past-tense like Neil Gaiman’s original novel. The main themes across the book will be Death, 
Friendship, Good vs Evil, Supernatural, Suffering, Depression, Judgement. 
CHAPTER 1: “THE NEW WORLD” 
In the first chapter, Bod lives in Reading, UK, where he works at a Tesco express. He lives in a small apartment in a 12-storey building. The house is mostly empty and he doesn’t like it. At work, he is constantly bullied and mistreated by his boss which makes him work after hours nearly everyday. This relates to the theme of suffering, the text will imply Bod’s feelings and emotions. The text will use emotive language, rhetorical questions like, “How would you feel?” or “Would you like it?” as well as direct speech. This will make the audience feel as if they were in Bod’s shoes, and they can relate to Bod’s emotions thus making the audience feel sympathy towards him. 
CHAPTER 2: “I QUIT” 
In the second chapter, Bod decides to quit his job at Tesco after the constant abuse from his boss. This makes him fall into a state of economic and moral depression, he will realise that he hasn’t got much money so he finds a temporary ‘job’ at UberEats. He starts to get frustrated and the chapter ends when he gets extremely annoyed so he bites his nail clean off. The theme of depression will be key in this chapter. This chapter will also make the audience feel sympathy for Bod. 
CHAPTER 3: “2 PIZZAS AND A COKE” 
The third chapter will start with the man Jack ordering two pizzas and a coke on UberEats. He does this to get a chance to finally end Bod’s life. Bod follows through with his order therefore delivering himself to the man Jack’s front door. The man Jack will try to kill Bod, however, Bod retaliates. Consequently, Bod injures his arm but escapes to find a doctor. He will be patched up by a nurse at the hospital, which is free in the UK. The chapter ends when he is discharged from the hospital. The main theme for this chapter is ‘good vs evil'. The audience will feel anger at the man Jack and also make them investigate further in the book what happens to Bod.
CHAPTER 4: “IN OR NOT?” 
During the fourth chapter, Bod will find a graveyard in Reading. There he will go in and roam around for a while, after sometime, the ghosts recognise him. They tell him he is famous within the ghost community. He asks for the freedom of the graveyard again. He is sent to the Valkyrie (a Valkyrie (“Chooser of the Slain”) is, in Norse mythology, any of a group of maidens who served the god Odin and were sent by him to the battlefields to choose the slain who were worthy of a place in Valhalla.). He will not be given the freedom of the graveyard in this chapter as he has to follow tasks to obtain his place in Valhalla. The main themes of this chapter are supernatural and death. It is a mysterious passage and the audience will perceive this phase of the book as strange and will feel hope for Bod that he gets the freedom of the graveyard. 
CHAPTER 5:
