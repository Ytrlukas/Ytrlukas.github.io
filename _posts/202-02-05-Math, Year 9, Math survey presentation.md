FINAL MATHEMATICS SURVEY REPORT
By Marco Pangione, Sabreena Mbon, Minseok Choi, S3 Mathematics.

How we carried out the survey:
We collected data from 110 randomly-selected students for the nationalities survey. 
We collected data from 77 randomly-selected students for the social media survey.

To collect the data, we made two tables, one to see how many people had and how long they used social media, and the other to find people’s nationalities and how many they had. The data collected was then put onto graphs and calculated in percentages to find the answers we were looking for. 

Question 1 was discrete quantitative/numerical data.
Question 2 was continuous quantitative/numerical data.
Question 3 was continuous quantitative/numerical data.
Question 4 was discrete quantitative/numerical data.

Our Questions:  
How many students of each nationality are there at EIPACA?
How many nationalities, on average, does each student at EIPACA have?
What percentage of students at EIPACA have social media?
On average, how long do students use social media for?


Our hypotheses: 
Question 1 - We thought that there were going to be many students with French nationality as we are in France. We also thought that most of the students would have European nationalities as there are more European countries than other entities participating in the ITER project. 
All nationalities available on our questionnaires were part of the ITER project.
Question 2 - We thought that most students would have either 1 or 2 nationalities as most countries allow a maximum of 2 citizenships. We thought our average was going to be around 1.5 nationalities each.
Question 3 - We thought that the vast majority of students at EIPACA have social media because, commonly, most people have social media, we thought that over 75% of students were going to have social media.
Question 4 - We thought the majority of students would spend around 0h to 2h 59m on social media per day. It would be alarming if students spent more than 3h on social media everyday.
Social media include YouTube, Discord, any Meta services, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, etc

NATIONALITIES SURVEY 1: TABLE WE USED BELOW

 We asked everybody the same question, “What nationality or nationalities do you have?” After that we filled in the table according to what the subject had said. 

From our data we found that most students have 1 nationality, this is because the average over the 110 randomly-selected students examined was 1.44. We also found that the French, Chinese and Italian nationalities are the most popular. 

RESULTS FROM TABLE ON NEXT PAGE:
Each student, on average, has around 1.4 nationalities.
The most common nationality is French with 48.18% of students examined having French citizenship
The second most common is Chinese with 18.18% of students examined having Chinese citizenship.
The third most common is Italian with 8.18% of students examined having Italian citizenship.

‘Other’ was not included as most of the nationalities differed from each other.

Countries not included (Austria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden) resulted in 0 replies so they are not on the list / table / chart.









These charts clearly illustrate the data explained on the previous slides.  They show that the most common citizenship is French.
We can also see that China and Italy have large slots in the pie chart and high bars on the bar graph.
It is important to note that “Other” was not  included as most nationalities differed from each other




SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEY: TABLE USED BELOW.
 
We asked all of the 77 randomly-selected students the same questions, “Do you have Social Media?” “How long do you use it for?” and “What do you identify as, Boy, Girl or Other?”

RESULTS FOUND FROM TABLE BELOW:
We found that 77.92%  at EIPACA have social media and 22.08% do not.
Most students use between 0h and 3h 59m of Social Media per day. 
The most common column selected was 0h - 59m across all 77 students.
Generally, Boys use Social Media more than Girls and Others.

THE CHARTS BELOW ILLUSTRATE THE DATA SHOWN ABOVE:





































From these charts we can clearly see that most students at EIPACA Manosque have social media. 
We can easily see that the most common usage of social media per day is 0 hours  to 59 minutes. This shows that our hypothesis was correct.
The genders are not included in the pie chart


CONCLUSION-FINAL REPORT-MATHEMATICS SURVEY:

For our survey we found that most of our predictions were right. Overall we collected data from a lot of students, this meant that our data has a higher chance of being 100% accurate.Our team found that most students at EIPACA are co-operative
and most replied to our questions. The main arguments throughout this report were the nationalities and social media survey results. 

On average a student at EIPACA has around 1.4 nationalities, this means that most students have one nationality. Also, we found that "French" is the most popular citizenship among the 110 randomly-selected students we examined. On the other hand, of the 77 randomly-selected students who participated in our social media survey, 60 of them had social media. In addition, most students at EIPACA use between 0h to 3h59m of social media per day. We also managed to find that Boys spend more time on social media than Girls and Others. 

WHAT WENT WELL:
We collected lots of data from a variety of students older and younger than us.
Our data is well organised and easy to read from the table and the charts.
We worked well together, this resulted in good contribution from all three of us in the group.
All over, we produced a good piece of information, at our school level.

EVEN BETTER IF:
We could have collected a bit more data on Day 2 (our least productive day of collecting data) this would have meant that we could have collected data from ~150 to ~175 students, which would have been amazing.
Also, we could've worked a bit better on the informatics's side of the survey as we don't think everybody saw the reports on Google Docs thoroughly enough.
