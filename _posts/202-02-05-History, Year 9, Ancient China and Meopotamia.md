ALL:  Ancient China
Salma: 

Lily: We are going to introduce Ancient China and we are going to compare it to Ancient Mesopotamia.

Lukas: I am going to introduce you to ancient china. Here is the map of ancient china and we can see that there are Mongolia and russia surrounding ancient china. As we can see, there is the yellow and mekong river. And we can observe lots of mountains such as Tian Shan. Comparing this to Mesopotamia there are as well 2 rivers/ the tigris and Euphrates
Ancient China was located in Eastern Asia.It was next to ancient Korea and next to ancient arabic civilizations. There was a huge sea in the west which was about 1,249,000 km².In the south-west, there was a huge desert. In the north, there was grassland. Therefore, we can clearly know how huge ancient China was. Today as we know ancient Mesopotamia is located in Iraq (Asia). Mesopotamia is around 300 miles long
Ancient China Terrains
In Ancient China, there were mountains,sea,desert and grassland.There were all kinds of terrains in Ancient China which clearly indicates how big Ancient China was.Due to its huge land with different terrains, there were a lot of resources that could not be found in the other civilizations. For example:diamond,gold,Iron and Jade.Jade was important to ancient chineses because they thought that Jade brought them fortune and peace.Due to the resources, Ancient China could be one of the strongest and most puissant ancient civilizations in the world. 


The Jade Jar
Here is an image of the Jade Jar. We are going to speak more about it on primary source
What happened in the different terrains?
In the arid zone (or the desert):
In the arid zone, there was a huge desert that was connected to other ancient civilizations, including: Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt and Rome. The route that was connected to other civilizations was called the “Silk road” . They passed to other countries through the silk road and sold goods. For example: Jade jar, diamond and paper. Unfortunately, there were many plunders so many traders died or were injured.
The silk route will be explained fully afterwards
In the grassland:
In the grassland, there were many wars between many civilization.Due to the flat land, it was easy to ride horse.Therefore, we can estimate that there were many cavalrymen.
In the mountain:
In the mountain, it was more peaceful than the grassland because there weren't any wars. People farmed and lived frugally which was different to grassland.
Conclusion geography
In Mesopotamia, there was only one terrain which was desert(or arid zone). Therefore, it had a higher temperature than Ancient China. The hot temperature  also affected Ancient Mesopotamian cloth and lifestyle.
Ancient China was a bigger civilization than Mesopotamia because they had more resources, more people and a bigger land. However, Mesopotamia  was united which is different to ancient China because it is composed of many civilizations. Ancient China was between a land and a sea. Mesopotamia was between 2 rivers: Euphrates and Tigris. Those 2 rivers contributed to Mesopotamia being a rich civilization. 
What was the most famous war in Ancient China

The Battle of Red Cliffs:
It is known as one of the biggest wars that happened in Ancient China. It is also considered as one of the largest naval wars (war in the sea) in history. It had been caused by 2 ancient  civilizations:Cao Cao and Han. Unfortunately, that battle eventually led  to the end of the Han Dynasty. Due to that war, there were many injuries and dead people and there were lands that were destroyed by the war. 
In Mesopotamia, there were also as many wars as in Ancient China. Unfortunately, there is no precise information about wars but according to weapons and armors found,  we can estimate that there were wars.
Transport
Ancient chineses used a variety of transportation, including: boats, charts, horse and donkey.  The transportation depended on the social classes.  For example, kings and noblemen rode carriage, cavalrymen rode horses and slaves or poor people rode donkeys. 
As there were many horses in Ancient China, horses were the main transportation.  Horses also contributed to Ancient China’s army. However, ancient mesopotamian rode more chariots 
instead of horses. 
Ancient chineses were talented at making ships and boats. Due to a huge sea, they could trade which is similar to Mesopotamia as they had 2 rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. Therefore, they both become rich due to the resources.
Due to the yellow sea, ancient chineses could develop at making ships which is similar to Mesopotamia.Ancient chineses mostly used horses for wars. However Mesopotamian used them more for domestication. They both also used ships to transport goods to another place or area
Artitecture
Ancient Chinese architecture wonderfully displays the long history and deep culture of China.
Ancient architecture in China stands out for its timberwork, elegant practicality and symmetry.
Wooden architecture was the mainstay of traditional Chinese buildings. Wood was preferred for most traditional architectural structures, from the halls of the Forbidden City to common houses.
The components were mainly columns, beams, and purlins, which were connected by tenons and mortises. China’s ancient wooden structures were quite intricately formed.
Elegant exterior

Existing examples of ancient Chinese architecture are greatly praised for their elegant profiles and varied features, such as overhanging eaves, upturned roof corners, and different shapes of roofs which clearly indicates how artistic they were.
The unique exteriors not only satisfied a practical function, but also had wonderful appearances. They are good examples of practicality and beauty combined.
Styles
Ancient Chinese architecture includes palaces, city walls, temples, pagodas, and houses. Their architectural styles varied with purpose. The main three types were imperial administration buildings, traditional residences, and religious buildings.
Imperial buildings
Ancient Chinese imperial buildings included palaces, government offices, and military defensive projects. All of them demonstrated the political control of the particular era. Generally, their architectural style was formal and solemn.
Taditional Residences

The architectural style of traditional Chinese residences was functional and suited to local conditions.
For example, in Southwest China, bamboo houses suited the muggy environment and local resources well.
In the northern part of Shaanxi Province where the weather is cold and dry in winter, the loess-carved dwellings were good at retaining heat and were cheap to construct
Religious Buildings
China has four official religions. Taoism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity have a long history in China.
nce the Chinese imperial court contributed to the introduction of Buddhism in China, Buddhist buildings in China normally followed the imperial style of construction, which was glorious and grand.
Taoist buildings in China were closer to the style of buildings for commoners compared to the other religious buildings.
Muslim architecture in China was a blend of traditional Chinese and Middle Eastern styles.
As for Christianity, most churches in China follow a Western architectural concept.
Comparison
In ancient China, buildings were usually one story because in ancient China, the first floor was believed to bring peace and fortune. However in Mesopotamia, people built tall buildings to indicate their power. 
In ancient China Mesopotamia their religious building was the ziggurat which was in the middle of the city which is different because in ancient China they did not have a rule for a religious building. However they believed gods were in their house. This will be described in more detail later
The architecture of ancient China is more focused on the indication of elegance and also their power. Nevertheless, Mesopotamian preferred a huge house instead of a small house.
Ancient Chinese palace is elegant, wide and also flat due to their myth that one story building bring them peace and fortune. However, Mesopotamain palace was tall because they had to communicate with gods.
Salma: Here is the timeline of Ancient china
It was started by the Shang Dynasty in 1700 BC where there became new lands. This dynasty lasted for around 600 years
In 1100 BC it ended and the Zhou dynasty started. They were a strong army and they replaced The wood and bamboo weapons to iron
In 771 BC the zhang dynasty ended because Invaders came to kill the Zhang ruler
Then in 551 BC Confusious was born. He was a philosopher made some fair quotes which we will see later
In 500 BC Confucius died and all of his moral lessons were written down by his students
Soon in 246 BC Ying Zheng “ The Grand Emperor” ,He divided his empire to 36 provinces
 In 210 BC Shi Huangdi died who was the first emperor of the Qin dynasty
In 40 BC Grand School opened by the government who was Wudi at the time
Finally In, 9 AD Wang Mang seized the throne an tried to break powers for owners
Com[aring this timeline to ancient Mesopotamia  they did have lots of Emperors and invasion such as the Sumerian and Persian…
For the difference to this they do not have on their timeline Schools or things to do with education except from King Hammurabi Laws 
Ancient China indeed has Laws which we will see later 
Lily:
Dynasties
Dynasties are a family ruling over a country or a part of a country for a long period of time. In China there were 13 Dynasties.
+The dynasties are:
Xia dynasty
Shang dynasty 
Zhou dynasty
Qin dynasty
Han dynasty
Six dynasties period 
Sui dynasty 
Tang dynasty
Five dynasties period, ten kingdoms
Song dynasty
Yuan dynasty
Ming dynasty
Qing dynasty

This is a map of the Xia dynasty
Zhou
Quin 
Tang 

Xia: The Xia Dynasty is the first dynasty in Ancient China. 
It is still debated because there was no writing at that time and only got information through ancient stories and ruins. 
It is said that this dynasty was very advanced for its time. They made houses out of bricks, made silk clothes and improved how much crops grew by using water systems.
The first Xia King, Yu, (it is said) that he repaired the damage caused by a big flood and legend says that the gods rewarded with “the mandate of heaven” or “the right to rule” 
Zhou: The Zhou dynasty is the longest dynasty in Ancient China. It  lasted for about 4 centuries.
Taoism, Confucianism, and Mohism. Writing  was codified, money (coins) was invented and chopsticks were used.
Zhou did lots of writing and was interested in astronomy and science.
Some of the greatest philosopher or poet are:Mencius, Lao-Tzu, Confucius, Mo Ti, Tao Chien and the military strategist Sun-Tzu 
Quin: The Qin Dynasty lasted for about 15 years by Qin Shi Huangdi (Emperor Qin)
During his reign, Emperor Qin built the great wall of China. He was also known for his “ruthless, megalomania and suppression of speech” ; he burnt hundreds of thousands of book and killed 460 Confucian scholars.
He also built himself a tomb by the Terracotta army of more than 8000 life-sized soldiers, 130 life-sized chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses.
+Tang:
The Tang Dynasty is also sometimes known as the Golden Age. It was a peaceful and prosperous era. One of the rulers included a female empress, the Empress Wu Zetian. She was the only female ruler in Ancient China.
Technology, Science, Literature, Art, Culture and Poetry improved in this Dynasty.
There was lots of travel, trade and shared knowledge in Ancient China as well as in (Ancient) Mesopotamia. The similarities with shared knowledge was in agriculture, farming and growing crops which has grown their environment and their society. 
+Comparison:
In Mesopotamia they also had dynasties like the Akkadian and the Babylonion and many other dynasties 
Kings were the rulers in mesopotamia. In Ancient China, they had Emperors and kings.
In ancient China the emperors were chosen by taking a test and in Mesopotamia the kings were normally passed down by a father to his son.
They both ruled through smaller cities.
In china emperors they controlled through feudalism.

+The Xia rulers: Yu, Qi, Tai Kang,  Zhong Kang, Xiang, Han Zhuo, Xiao Kang, Zhu, Huai, Mang, Xie, Bu Xiang, Jiong, Jin, Kong Jia, Gao…
The Zhou rulers: Wu, Cheng, Kang,  Zhao, Mu, Gong, Yi,  Xiao, Yi, Li, Xuang, You, Ping, Huang, Zhuang, Xi, Hui,  Xiang, Qing, Kuang, Ding…
The Qin ruler: Qin Shi Huangdi The 
Tang rulers: Yuan, Shimin, Zhi, Xian, Dan, Xian...
As In Mesopotamia they had lots of different rulers .
Salma: 
+Economies
China's economy was mostly based  on agriculture. Trading was very important in ancient chineses life. It helped them to get rich and more powerful. They traded and sold silk which was a lot in ancient china, also salt, sugar, spices and lots more. Lots of things that they sold were very rich  and useful. 
Trade was  very successful in Ancient China’s history, tHey exchanged many objects which help them to make better technology with the trading they have done
+Comparison
In  Mesopotamia they traded many different things than ancient China Like: Grains, oils, Pottery, Jewelry and many more. In mesopotamia they used the the tigris and the Euphrates river however the ancient chineses used the Yellow river for trading and  The silk road
In ancient china they used currency which was coins which were normally made with copper but also silva and gold but in Mesopotamia used Shekel as currency. The both civilisations used coins for currency



+Trade routes
In Ancient China they used a trade route which was called “The Silk Route”. It started at Xi’an in central-northern China and it end at Anatolia in Turkey then the goods are shipped to other countries
The Silk route goes through Ancient China, Asia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome and Britain and many other countries. It was mostly used for trade to other countries. 
On this route, They mostly traded silk but they also traded other things like wool, tea ,sugar and many more

+Comparison:
However, in Mesopotamia they have no trade routes except from the rivers: Tigris and Euphrates.
The silk route is known as a route that traded silk. This was not a river they traded by walking a long way. Through many different countries. In Mesopotamia they never had such a thing like that; they only used the 2 rivers to trade the Tigris and the Euphrates. In ancient China they also had a yellow river that used to trade in. 
Inventions
Ancient China was very famous for its inventions.
The compass, paper, printing and gunpowder are the most famous inventions. It is also called the Four Great Inventions Of Ancient China.
They also invented many other things which includes: Tea production, silk, kites, deep drilling, porcelain and noodles.
Their games:
Stone balls, flying kites, hide and seek, watching shadow plays, firecrackers…


Invention timeline
+Comparison:
Mesopotamian as well were very creative because they created the plow, wheel and many more….

Society:
+Ancient China’s Hierarchy:
1.The Emperor			6.The Shang class
2.The Soldiers			7.Slaves
3.The Shi class 
4.The Nong class 
5.The Gong Class 
The emperors were the one in charge and they were fully respected. Soldiers were not very respected and some yes
+Nong and Shi Class:
The Shi class are nobles. They were well taught and were scholars of Imperial China. They are low-class aristocrats so they had limited power over people, and could conduct and command a group of armies for wars. Nobles were also known for their sword skills. 
The Nong class are peasant farmers. They were quite important because they had to nourish the whole kingdom. They have their own patch of land to farm. 
+Gong and Shang class
The Gong class was artisan and craftsmen, they made merchandise for the higher classes. They weren’t really respected, had limited rights but they were wealthy. They didn't own any land but rented them with goods and money. 
The Shang class was merchants, bankers, shopkeepers and traders. They transported and traded with the higher class. They were wealthy but had no respect. Some of them can get into a higher class if they have enough money. 
+Comparison:
In Mesopotamia There was always the king and the priest first. The king would take in charge of the city state.  In ancient China they had an emporer for each dynasty, they would take charge on whats happening and religion. Then in ancient China they had soldiers who weren't treated very well they had to be with the emporer and fight for him however in mesopotamia they had  nobility and rich merchants. Nobles were for the administration and the rich merchants which they traded food. In third class of mesopotamia there is found the poor mechants, farmers and artisans. Artisans were very important because they made lots of important objects in their daily lifes like pots, Jewelry, dishes and many more. Then, in ancient China were the Shi, Nong, Gong, Shang class. The Shi class were the noble, the gong the farmers, the shang the craftsman and the Shang the merchants. Finally, in Mesopotamia and in ancient China  we can see there is the slaves. But the slaves did not have the same kobs in joth cilivisation.  In Mesopotamia they used slaves to do services for wealthy people and priest however in ancient China they use them to help the royal family. We will focused more on that later. We can see that the Mesopotamian had a very different life to the Chinese.

+Salma: In Ancient China they had many different cultures. One of them was chinese tea and it was discovered to be a medicine in the Zhou era. It was also used as a offering During the Tang era and even after that it was a great help for the Tibitan empire 
Buildings of large projects and Architectural styles.
In Ancient China they builded lots of clever and huge buildings. In the Xia kingdom it was well known that the king Yu when he was 53 that he was very useful in stopping the Yellow river from flooding by engineering projects. He also increased the wealth of agriculture by building canals and many more.they is also the great wall which is the longest ancient architectural structure. In Mesopotamia they also built forts to protect them however it was over a city state as well as Ancient China.
+In Ancient China they had many other types of cultures like writing and many more
in Ancient China they made lots of different styles of art.
Calligraphy was a type of writing which chinese considered as art. There were lots of caracistics. In their culture it is obligatory to write every letter perfectly and each line has its own order. In Mesopotamia they did not have another type of writing for art, they only had cuneiform as there writing
Poetry was art for ancient chineses as well. It was a very important culture and all Chinese educators had to write poetry. This was mostly done in the Tang dynasty. This was also examined in Ancient china. In Mesopotamia the sumerians made poetry, the first female poet by the sumerians was called Enheduanna 
 Finally they had art which was also important for them. Mostly, the people who wrote and learned poetry was the people who was inspired by painting

+Entertainment
  For entertainment, in ancient China they were many things like: kites, card games, board games and many more…
Kites:  This was in the Tang dynasty the kites were very inspired by people and entaintertained lots of people. It was made with bamboo frames and silk. They were often decorated with many different patterns. Kites were used at festivals sometimes and for fun moments. It was also used for signs and messages, maybe to call people, to send signs of danger and lots more…
Card games: Card games were also mostly used in the Tang dynasty. They made a type of card game called chao which people still play now
 Board games: In ancient China they enjoyed playing board games. Some people call this game “chinese chess” because it is a bit like chess. One of the most played is called Go and it is usually played with two players. They are coins on the grid table and the aim of this game is to take a large amount of the side of the opponent.
+In Mesopotamia there were also games and entertainments; most of them was board games but they also had active games like: hunting ,boxing and many more…  In mesopotamia the rich played any instrument in their free time such as the flute. Story-telling was also a big subject for entertaining. These stories would be passed from generation to generation so lots of people could hear it. These stories were written on clay tablets. In Ancient China they also had storytelling. But itu is different because history teller was traditionally a job. Their job was to tell these stories to the upper class and even sometimes to the court.
+Music played a big role in ancient china’s culture because from time they was new music instrument developed
Music was used ,around 8000 years, for fun, religion, parties and lots more. Ancient China instruments were always divided into eight groups depending on what the music instrument was made from. The groups are: Bamboo, hide, clay, ground, metal, stone and wood. These still exist today in China.
They use silk as a material for strings like the pipa. Bamboo was for the wood instruments with wind, for example the Bawu which looks kind of like a flute, Hide  was the only material used for drums, chime .They also used stone and clay for chimes. They made bells, gongs and chimes with metal.

+Here are some images of some instruments 
+Comparison
In Mesopotamia they did not have as much material as ancient china had but they still had some material like copper, bronze, gold, metal and iron. They made lots of creative things with these materials like the wheel and many more
 Unfortunately there are not lots of prove on this
Ancient China was polytheism like  Mesopotamian. ancient chinese believed that gods are monsters and dragons which was different to Mesopotamia as they did not believe in dragons. They had tiny gods and giant gods which they respected, For example: Tattletale, a chinese kitchen god,  for the people to respect him, before the chinese new years they took some sweets and placed them in the kitchen. Then, soon they would eat it. They believed that this would give them joy and happiness all over the year. 
+Festivals
In Ancient China there were several festivals: The most important one out of all of them is Chinese new year or spring Festival. This festival lasted for 15 days and it was used to bring family together and honor.There is also moon festival, it was a harvest festival  
+3 main religion
There are 3 main religions in the ancient history of china. The first one is Taoism which is a belief of a way of thinking about life and living a peaceful life for their own soul to live the afterlife forever. “Tao” which means “way or path”. In Mesopotamia as well they believed in the afterlife that they have a soul.
 The second one is Confucianism which is a belief to live in life with having a moral and being truthful. This came from a man called Confucius who was a philosopher who made some fair quotes “ Forget injuries never forget kindness” and ”It doesn't matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop. This reminds us of king Hammurabi laws codes because they both include fairness and equality. 
The last and final belief was called Buddhism which one around 500 AD. This was based on Buddha who was the founder of Buddhism. They believed that there was a “rebirth” only when they lived a proper life. Then they shall enter Nirvana ( heaven)
+Comparison 
 These two civilizations are both polytheistic. They believed that each god had their own job, responsibility and power. For example god of magic, god of storms and many others
Manners of gods was kind of similar to Mesopotamia because the priest would give gods some treat however the chineses would eat the treat after because the gods could not eat them.
+ Literacy
Literature was mostly used in the Shang dynasty.The ancient China history literacy includes many things like: poetry, religious documents, scientific work, stories and fiction. They wrote creative stories on ghosts, as they believed it was their god, and many other myths.
Around the Shang dynasty slowly they started to write scripts. Their handwriting was called Jiaguwen and it was pictographic writing.
They used to write on many materials, most of them were bamboo silk and wood for their  important documents and their own creations like poetry and stories.
Lily:  Here are some quotes from one of the famous writers in ancient china:
“Appear weak when you are strong, appear strong when you are weak.”
“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable at night, and when you move, fall like thunderbolt.”
-Sun Tzu, the art of war
Here are some images of the chinese writing
+
 In the Shang dynasty they have done lots of things, one of the things they have done is that they have written Laws. They also invented Books and Laws for punishment.
Respect was very important in ancient china's laws. They were very strict with this. Ancient chinese people had to show great respect for their ancestors.
The most important laws were brought during the Zhou dynasty. They were mostly about respecting their ancestors.
For example: If a girl abuses their parents they will be strangled and if they have wounded their parents they will be cut into two. There was no defence for them or no chances.
If you were guilty for a crime the punishments would either be twisting arms or/and legs around a pole or getting cut. The way they would cut you off first is your eyebrow, then the shoulders, the breasts, legs and arms and at the end, the heart.
+In ancient China there were 6 laws everyone had to know
The 6 main laws that every man had to know in Ancient china:
“Every man must carry duties with obedience”
“You must always show greatest respect to family ancestors”
“Avid legal actions as far as possible”
“Lots of care shown to the people who run the public school”
“All people should be reminded of all laws regularly”
“Control you anger outbursts”
Salma: 
Here are some images of punishments of the time
+Similarities and differences on Literacy and laws

In Mesopotamia they also had a prictrogramic type of writing just called cuneiform. Every form written represented something as well as Mesopotamia. Also, they both wrote religious documents and literature as in the story of “The epic of gilgamesh “ and many more, but they did not write scientific things as ancient china has done In Mesopotamia they written thing on clay tablets but however In ancient China they used to write on objects like: wood and sometimes silk because they had lots.

Around 11 century B.C
More than 3000 years old
Used it to pleased gods
Bronze
They presented this to their gods and filled it up with wine. They believed that the gods would be pleased with them and in the afterlife their gods would treat them nicely and serve them some wine.
This precious alto



Emperor or Slaves:
The Emperor was the highest person in the hierarchy. They had the most land and had the most wealth. The emperor ruled through small cities. They were the ones who made the major decisions. And usually ask talented soldiers or nobles to help their decisions.  There was normally one emperor at a time and the son would usually take over the throne.

Salma:  Slavery is said to be existed in the Shang dynasty. If their mother was a slave their kids will be noticed as a slave. The normal slaves respected the farmers and worked for them and also sometimes they would build roads and work for the government. For these slaves they were sad because everyday they would do the same thing, dress the same and eat the same.
However, these slaves are lucky because they had an easier life than the slaves who work for the royal family. They had to do everything they were told. They were treated with cruelty and when their master died they also died too

Comparison
In Mesopotamia they also had slaves. They used to help rich and wealthy in cleaning the house, the chores and many more...They also done work for the priest but they did not go on top of the ziggurat because it was only the priest job. Sometimes slaves worked in farms. This is very different to ancient China because they done different jobs but some were similar for example respecting the farmers.
