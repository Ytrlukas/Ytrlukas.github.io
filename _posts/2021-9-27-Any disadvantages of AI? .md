### Disadvantages of AI

Contrary to my previous post, this time I would like to talk about the problems and disadvantages caused by artificial intelligence. Let's also pay attention to the dark side of technological advancement!
High Costs of Creation
As artificial intelligence evolves, the hardware and software required for artificial intelligence must also be kept up to date. It needs a constant update process as it meets the requirements. Also, machines don't heal on their own like humans. So repairs and maintenance are required, and the process is costly.

Making Humans Lazy
Artificial intelligence automates most tasks. So humans are lazy because artificial intelligence takes over the work. Just as many people are addicted to social media like Instagram or Facebook today, artificial intelligence may cause even greater addiction in future generations.

Unemployment
Artificial intelligence replaces humans with repetitive tasks and many other tasks. When human needs disappear, there is no reason to hire, and unemployment increases. Every organization wants artificial intelligence to automate tasks that can deliver great efficiencies at a lower cost than using a relatively expensive workforce.
