 Plan: in another world, there were 5 creatures- Fodo demands his grandson to get medicine so he can be immortal- the medicine is protected by the dragon-Frodo’s grandson's son got it safely and handed him over.




The story begins in another mysterious world called Peruzilia which resembles Earth, since there is all sorts of terrain that we can discover on Earth. It contains: forests, seas, rivers and mountains. The world is composed of 6 creatures, behaving like human beings: Orcs, Elves, Hobbits, Dragons, Dwarves and Wizards (a very small minority since it’s hard to be a wizard). 

In a hole in the ground there lived two little hobbits called Frodo and Yob (Frodo’s grandson). Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole and that means comfort and happiness. Our once young hobbit, Frodo, is now 99 years old, waiting sadly for his death upon his armchair reading his great uncle, Bilbo Baggin’s diary, who passed away 50 years ago. He was once  a great young burglar, traveled the world with Gandalf, with the Dwarf prince and with the Dwarf prince’s tiny dwarfish soldiers, who apparently died on the battlefield against the Orks. There was something precious that his uncle discovered during the journey; a little tiny ring that allows you to be invisible. He didn’t tell Gandalf about it since he realised that he would take it because there was a dark magical spell upon it . The ring was passed to his nephew (Frodo). Therefore, Frodo has possessed it since he was 20 years old. There’s something he worries about: his ring, which is really precious, so he wants to keep it eternally. Frodo demands that  his grandson gets medicine that can make him immortal. He obviously refuses this request because he reckons that the medicine is being protected by a dragon and that there is a dark spell upon it. But, he realises that his grandfather will die in a few days, so he decides to leave the next morning. He travels the world for a long time, meets lots of creatures: Orcs, Elves, Hobbits, Dragons, Dwarves and Wizards (a very small minority since it’s hard to be a wizard). Fortunately, the Orcs were not  tempted to eat Yob, since they had never seen a Hobbit before and didn’t know what they tasted like. Yob finally arrived at the place where the dragon lived. He obtains the medicine easily, returns home safely and hands it to Frodo.
