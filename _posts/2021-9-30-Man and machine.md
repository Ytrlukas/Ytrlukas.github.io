Man and Machine

If we want to revolutionize technology, science and commerce( because of its rapid production), man and machine have to work together.  This is the good side of that couple, but unfortunately there are also negative sides of it; less jobs, air pollution and bad work conditions for its employees. Therefore, I think that the relationship between humans and machines should be harmonious.


I chose a painting, named “Disques de la ville”, painted by Fernand Léger in 1920. At the center of this drawing I can see bright colors : red, yellow, blue and orange, which symbolise loud noises. I can also see people painted in gray, who are looking in the same way, in different directions, as if they wonder about what is happening in front of their houses. In the background, my attention is caught by the way the buildings are all constructed. They are all constructed in various ways; some of them 2d and some of them are 3d.  I beI found this drawing very interesting since it was fascinating to see the combination of the sound and the buildings. I think the message is the cohabitation of loud noises and humans. This painting is positive  because of its bright color and the atmosphere it creates.


For the second drawing, I chose a painting called Making engine by Christopher R.W in1997. At the center of the image, I can see a man who looks depressed and sad. The black and white background gives an impression of sadness. The machines,  diagonally placed, indicate its repetitive movement, meaning that it works persistently( unlike humans).  I found that workers are confined because we can see that they do not have much space to work. In my opinion, the message of this artwork is how badly workers were treated at that time. This is indeed negative because of its colors and the atmosphere it creates.


My creation is showing the negative impact of the factory by putting a hand on it to show that the workers want to escape from there. It is colored in black to indicate pollution and depression. Alice and I decided not to put doors in our creation to give an impression of prison.
