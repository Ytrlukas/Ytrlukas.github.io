###Social-media can affect you positively?

Nowadays, due to increasing numbers of devices, 80 percent of human-being rely on social media for communication, for study and for entertainment. Some people think that social-media can affect you negatively, but I strongly believe that it is not and I am going to try to convince you.


The first positive impact of social media is that it can reduce stress, anxiety and depression. 
One  example of that impact can be the following; there was a boy, named John, whose dad was famous and unfortunately passed away. He was depressed and anxious that something similar happens again to him.  He wanted to share his feelings and sadness with people, who were admiring his dad, so he started to express his feelings on social-medias; snapchat, instagram and facebook.  Many people helped him by sending supporting messages and he got better. The reason why social-media can ease stress, anxiety and depression is because  human-beings are social-creatures who find indispensable to share their feelings and their experiences with people. 
Another advantage of social media is facilitating communication.


The second positive impact of social-media is facilitating communication. Nowadays, it allows children to stay in touch with their parents. Considering safety and security, it is important for children to contact their family whenever they need. Facilitating communication is essential for everyone since we must communicate with our loved ones. Furthermore, it can also save your life in urgent situations. However, there are several problems that have come up due to social media. 


One problem is that it can cause a distraction from productive tasks. Many students communicate with their friends at times when they should be studying. This happened several times during my own school in Korea. Furthermore, excessive use of social-medias can make students neglect important social activities. School days are an important time for developing social-skills and life-long friendships. In conclusion, social-media can be bad for you, if you canâ€™t control yourself.

There is no doubt that social-media can be beneficial for everyone, but it can also distract you.I believe it depends on the way you use it, but certainly, it can benefit you if you can control yourself.
